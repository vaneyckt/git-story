== Introduction
Have you ever found yourself wondering how a particular commit made it into the master branch? A commit probably started its live on a separate branch before making it way to the master branch through a series of pull requests and merges. This merge history can be quite complex and there is no tool that just shows you the relevant merges. The git-story ruby script aims to remedy this.

== Example
Finding all the ways that a given commit could have made it into a particular branch is as easy as running

    git-story --commit <your commit sha here> --branch <your branch name here>

The output will be of the form

    Possible path
    -------------
    <commit date>  <commit sha>  <commit message>  <author>  START
    <commit date>  <commit sha>  <commit message>  <author>  MERGE
    <commit date>  <commit sha>  <commit message>  <author>  MERGE
    ...
    <commit date>  <commit sha>  <commit message>  <author>  HEAD
