- grit throws an error for stack overflow due to recursion on big git repos.
- large repos are really slow to search.

== Introduction
Have you ever found yourself wondering what branch a particular commit came from in git? Or how your master branch ended up containing that commit that really shouldn't be there? That commit probably started its live on a separate branch before making its way to the master branch through a series of pull requests and merges. This merge history can be quite complex and there is no tool that just shows you the relevant merges. The git-story ruby script aims to remedy this.

== Getting Started
First you'll need to install the git-story gem, as this will download the other gems required to run this script:

  gem install git-story

Next you'll want to download the script file from the /lib folder and make it executable by running:

  chmod u+x git-story

== Example
Finding all the ways that a given commit could have made it into a particular branch is as easy as running

    git-story --commit <your commit sha here> --branch <your branch name here>

The output will be of the form

    Possible path
    -------------
    <commit date>  <commit sha>  <commit message>  <author>  START
    <commit date>  <commit sha>  <commit message>  <author>  MERGE
    <commit date>  <commit sha>  <commit message>  <author>  MERGE
    ...
    <commit date>  <commit sha>  <commit message>  <author>  HEAD
